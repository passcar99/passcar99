### Hi there 👋
I'm Pasquale and this is my GitHub profile. 

I'm a Computer Science and Engineering Alumnus from Polimi specialized in Artificial Intelligence. My interests are software development :computer:, statistics :chart_with_upwards_trend: and deep learning :brain:.

This repo mostly contains the code of some of the personal and academic projects I did in the last few years. I hope to contribute more as time allows.
Most of the code is not meant to be optimized in every aspect since it was meant either as a personal experiment or as a means to test some skill at the university.
Specifically, the university projects are:
* [Prova-Finale-API](https://github.com/passcar99/Prova-Finale-API) is the first relatively big project for the Algorithms and Principles of Computer Science cointaing an implemetation of HashTrees with Red-Black trees in pure C from scratch to support a mock "social network".
* [I-versione-PFRL](https://github.com/passcar99/I-versione-PFRL) is the implementation in VHDL of a component producing the translation of addresses on a bus according to working zones.
* [MarketingGame](https://github.com/passcar99/MarketingGame) is the implementation of a website for collecting questionnaires about products and is meant as an exercise with Enterprise Java Beans and Java Persistence API.
* [SE_RP_2021_4a_PS](https://github.com/LesLivia/SE_RP_2021_4a_PS) is a research project in Formal Methods in the healthcare domain for the Software Engineering II course. I contributed some models to the framework which later made a tiny contribution to one of the main researcher's papers.
* [ola-project](https://github.com/passcar99/ola-project) is the project for the Online Learning Application exam simulating the interaction of random users with a website selling some products and a learning agent optimizing the advertising campaign according to data.
* [bayesmix](https://github.com/giacomodecarlo/bayesmix), as a group project we contributed a hirarchy for Factory Analytic models to the bayesmix library, intended for running MCMC simulations for  Bayesian mixture models.
* I plan on including relevant code from many other projects (Artificial Neural Networks, Recommender Systems, Model Identification and Data Analysis, Software Engineering thesis, ...) in the future.

[utilities](https://github.com/passcar99/utilities) contains some utilities automating tedious tasks such as modifying PDFs and plotting Uppaal traces from tracefiles.
